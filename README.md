# gitlog-metrics

If you want to get some statistics from your git history, this might help you. 

This is based the work of Adam Thornhill, the author of "Code as a Crime scene", who later created Empead/Codescene, wrote some tools to go along with his book. They have since been migrated into Codescene, but still available on [code-maat](https://github.com/adamtornhill/code-maat).

## Quick Start

```
  ./getmetrics.sh  <project name> <start date> <path to repo> <code-maat path>
```

If you want to have this is a Jenkins pipeline, there is a Jenkinsfile that you can look at.

## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress.
